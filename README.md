# TagPyrenees
TagPyrenees is a tag system use to find the files which contain the specific tag

## Originally
I implemented lots of codes with DSA project, each algorithm or data structure usually contains one or more algorithm or data structure.
Therefore, if I want to know which have some tag for learning. It must need a tag mechanism to help me to know. That is, this project borned...

## How to use
1. Add tags to your file's third line like: /* @tag: sort,stack,binarytree */  (don't use any space in your tag name)

2. run command to do what you want
```
>>> go run . query ./ tree
[binarytree.go]
>>> go run . listtags ./
[sort stack binarytree]
```
