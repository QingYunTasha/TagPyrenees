# TagPyrenees
TagPyrenees is a tag system use to find the files which contain the specific tag

## Originally
I implemented lots of codes in DSA repository, each algorithm or data structure usually contains one or more algorithm or data structure.
Therefore, if I want to know which have some tag for learning. It must need a tag mechanism to help me to know. That is, this project borned...

## How to use
1. Add tags to your file's third line like: /* @tags: sort,stack,binarytree */  (don't use any space in your tag name)

2. run tagpyrenees.exe(or directly run the source code) to do what you want
```
>>> ./tagpyrenees.exe query . tree
[binarytree.go]
>>> ./tagpyrenees.exe listtags .
[sort stack binarytree]
```

## Why use "Pyrenees" as project name?
